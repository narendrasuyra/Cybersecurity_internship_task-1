In this task, I successfully performed a comprehensive network scan using Nmap. I identified live hosts, open ports, and associated services within the local network. The scan results were thoroughly analyzed to determine potential security risks. 
I also explored the use of Wireshark for packet analysis to gain deeper insight into network traffic. 
Finally, the scan output was saved in a structured format and uploaded to my GitHub repository, demonstrating my ability to document and share technical findings effectively. 
This activity enhanced my practical skills in network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment â€” essential components of ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
